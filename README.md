## 🏥 Project Overview

In emergency healthcare, rapid triage is critical. This project applies machine learning to **Road Traffic Accident (RTA)** data to automate two key diagnostic predictions:
1.  **Patient Status Prediction:** Binary classification (Alive vs. Deceased) to prioritize critical care.
2.  **Injury Type Prediction:** Multiclass classification to identify specific injury patterns (Severe, Minor, etc.).

We implemented an end-to-end data science pipeline—from raw data cleaning to hyperparameter tuning—benchmarking traditional ML models against Deep Learning approaches.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The repository includes the **raw dataset** used for this analysis.
* **File:** `RTA_Dataset.xlsx` 
* **Description:** Contains patient demographics, accident timestamps, vehicle details, and hospital admission info.
* **Preprocessing:** The notebook handles missing value imputation, timestamp extraction (Hour/Day/Month), and categorical encoding (One-Hot/Label).

## 📊 Key Results & Benchmarks

We compared **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and ANNs**.

### 1. Patient Status (Survival) Prediction
**Winner:** SVM (RBF Kernel) achieved **83.6% Accuracy**, outperforming deep learning models on this tabular data.

### 2. Injury Type Prediction
**Winner:** XGBoost achieved **81.2% Accuracy**, demonstrating superior handling of multiclass imbalances.

### 3. Data Insights
Our analysis revealed significant correlations between accident time, vehicle type, and injury severity.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The project follows a standard industry lifecycle:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values in `HospitalName` and removing outliers.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Deriving temporal features from timestamps to capture "rush hour" accident trends.
3.  **Scaling:** Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize features for SVM and ANN stability.
4.  **Modeling:**
    * **Classical ML:** Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
    * **Boosting:** XGBoost (Gradient Boosting).
    * **Deep Learning:** A 3-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
